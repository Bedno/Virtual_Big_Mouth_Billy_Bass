Web-based version of the iconic "Big Mouth Billy Bass" toy.  Speaks Chicago weather, fortunes, songs and more.

Evolved from the classic hacker project of modifying the toy to speak from external input, this version skips the hardware complexity by simulating the entire experience on any modern browser.

Though talking parrot apps were around since late 80s and Max Headroom, and virtual newscasters were a thing by the late 90s, in recent searches on the topic I was unable to find any modern examples.  I therefore embarked on creating such a thing, and chose browser based as an easiest solution, though there's some tradeoff in capabilities.
